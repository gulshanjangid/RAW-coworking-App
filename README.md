# RAW Coworking Space

A new Flutter project designed to streamline the coworking experience. This app provides a seamless interface for members to manage their workspace, payments, and bookings, while offering a comprehensive dashboard for administrators.

## ✨ App UI and Features
The app features a clean, modern, and intuitive user interface with a red and white color scheme. It's designed for both coworking members and administrators, with distinct dashboards and functionalities for each.

## User-Facing Features
   ### Splash & Home Screen
The app welcomes users with a clean splash screen before opening a personalized dashboard. The home screen shows the user's name, their assigned cabin/seat, and provides quick access to key features.

 ### Booking & Reservations
Users can easily book one-day passes for coworking spaces or reserve meeting rooms. The interface clearly displays pricing, amenities, and provides a simple form for scheduling.

  ### Invoicing & Service Requests
An integrated system for managing payments allows users to view pending invoices and their due dates. A dedicated section also lets users submit service requests or complaints with a title and description.

## Admin Dashboard & Management
   ### Admin Dashboard
A central hub for admins provides quick access to manage all aspects of the coworking space, including users, events, complaints, invoicing, and meeting room bookings.

   ### User Management
Admins have comprehensive tools to manage the community. They can view a list of all current users, edit their details, or add new members to the system through a simple and intuitive form.

## 📂 Folder Structure
The project is organized into a Flutter frontend and a Node.js backend, with a clear and scalable structure.

### Frontend (Flutter)
The Flutter application code is primarily located in the lib directory, separated into modules for admin, user pages, and general logic.
